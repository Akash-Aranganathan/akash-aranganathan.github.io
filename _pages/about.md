My interest has been to investigate biological molecules. I began my research career with the analysis of protein folding intermediates and pathways during my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. In Dr. Athi N. Naganathan's lab, I worked on an Ising-like model called **block-WSME (bWSME)**. Currently, in my Ph.D. I am working with Dr. Pratyush Tiwary in combining Artificial Intelligence and statistical mechanics to develop models for investigating and predicting protein conformational ensembles. To this end, I have developed a methodology, **AlphaFold2RAVE**, to calculate the free energy landscape and a biologically relevant reaction coordinate for any given protein sequence. I am also working with Dr. Grégoire Altan-Bonnet on developing models to enhance immunotherapy by inferring the dynamics of proteins present at the synapse. I am currently studying the dissociation process of multiple protein molecules to infer their collective biological function. Moving forward, I aim to develop multiscale modeling of biological molecular interactions to better understand their function.
